## ASTM E1394 Message Parsing

This project demonstrates generically reading and creating ASTM  E1394 messages. 

In 2015, I started working with vendors and customers to help them interface with my company's new instrument. The message format was ASTM E1394 (ASTM). I started to wonder how LIS and middleware vendors were able to adapt to connecting with so many instruments, as each instrument manufacturer developed its own message format based on the ASTM E1394 standard.

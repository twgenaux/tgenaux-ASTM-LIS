# ASTM E1394 and HL7 v2 Message Parsing and related Code and Projects

## Projects

### ASTM Message Parsing
This project is the result of exploring two goals; generically reading and writing ASTM messages and using bi-directional maps to map database orders, patients, and results to create and read ASTM messages.

This project also works with HL7 Version 2.5 messages.

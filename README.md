# ASTM E1394 and HL7 v2 Message Parsing and related Code and Projects

## Projects

### ASTM Message Parsing
This project is a proof of concept of generically reading and writing ASTM messages along with using bi-directional maps to map database orders, patients, and results to create and read ASTM messages. The project supports round-tripping, in which a message read can be recreated from the information extracted.

This project also works with HL7 Version 2.5 messages.
